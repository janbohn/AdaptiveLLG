# AdaptiveLLG
space and time adaptive algorithm for the LLG equation, preprint will follow shortly

may be adapted to any other time dependend PDE by replacing the LLG equation by an other. PDE should be discretized by second order (multistep) method in time, otherwise the time estimator maybe should to be modified. 

runs with FENICS 2019.1.0
